# preface
For my part of this project I worked with Adrian and Angel through Discord pretty much exclusively due to issues with my Github, a lot it stemming from me having SSH keys for my security 
setup which makes it very difficult for me to pull or push.  I am going to attach a litany of screenshots that show not only did I do ALL of the tutor, postings, messages, and most of the
HomeController coding and functionality, but that I also helped both of my teammates with their code as well (they of course pulled their weight, it was just a collaborative effort having
some things to work together.  I will include the folder full of those screenshots within this branch, although there are plenty that are older - I  did not want to scroll back to them as
the point should be made apparent pretty quickly that this was our preferred method of sharing work (compressing project, putting in discord, repeat with others code after they worked on it)
It is also of note that we spent the last two days physically in person writing code on each others devices and from a literal collabortive standpoint, almost like the way it was mentioned
in class that sometimes developer pairs work together and trade off.  I could not have gotten this far without these two and I know they would say the same for me, during every part of this
project they were both selfless and I did my best to return the favor.  In synopsis, just check out the screenshot folder and it will be apparent that I worked on all of my stuff and some 
of the functionality and ftlh formatting for my teammates as well.

# in regard to presenting#
For our presentation our goal was to all showcase our information from Adrian's laptop, but due to Software difficulties Angel had to showcase his on his own.  That being said when we 
learned of this pivot, Adrian and I did still have a scenario set up verbally, we just did not write it down, but I will transcribe that here:
## - Customer (Adrian) showcases their profile and the post they joined, send a message to the tutor, then go into the thread to showcase that it updated as applicable
## - Customer then presses on the home button to traverse to the landing page and show that they can log out if they choose (show session)
## - Customer then looks up a course type and finds a course related, add the course to their profile, show that on profile log out
## - Provider (Me) logs into the provider account that the customer messaged at the beginning and look at profile page, showcase ability to edit any aspect of it and change something
## - Press on all posts, show that the posts are separated such that it will show whether a post is claimed by a student or not, create a new post to do so 
## - Reply to the customer message that the customer sent at the beginning show that it is reflected in the thread as well and has the correct username
## - Search up course to show it is posted, go back to profile, delete the post, search it again and show that there are no longer posts with that name
## - Sign out or delete account
